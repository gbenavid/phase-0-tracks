    <h1>Hello, World.</h1>
    
    <p>Many people ask me why I love cats, well... I can explain.
    </p>
    
    <p>It all started when my two front teeth fell out at the age of six. My Nanny was watching over me for the night and I went running over to her to deliver the exciting news.
    </p> 
    
    <p>The next morning I woke up to find a little black & white kitten with a message that read,
    </p>
    
	<h2>
    	<em>
    	'--- Love, The ToothFairy.'
    	</em>
    </h2>
	<h4>
	  There he was, waiting for me inside a bubble-gum pink Barbie gift bag.
	</h4>

  <em>'What should I name him?!?!'
  </em>

  <p>My Nanny and I came up with a list.
  </p>
    
  <h3>It included:</h3>
    
    <ul>
    	<li>Licorice</li>
    	<li>Slinky</li>
    	<li>Maxi</li>
    	<li>Bamboo</li>
    	<li>Syd</li>
    </ul>
   
   <p>After much contemplation we boiled it down to our top three picks.
   </p>
   
   <ol>
   	<li>Maxi</li>
   	<li>Slinky</li>
   	<li>Syd</li>
   </ol>
   
   <p>Maxi it is! We cuddled up and I loved him instantly.
   </p>

   <p>
   	Since then I've had a few more cats, each special in their own way. One thing that I appreciate about cats is their shared love for <a href="http://www.rachelmaddow.com/">Rachel Maddow</a>. Together, my cats and I have cuddled up every Friday and devoutly tuned in at 9PM (PST)
