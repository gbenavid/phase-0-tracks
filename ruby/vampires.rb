# the prompt will continuely update the variable to a true or false value based on the conditional if statement it is passed through. When the prompts are finished you will have one remaning outcome of wheather this guy is a vampire or not.

# Print the result at the end of the survey.

# ------NOTES TO SELF
# Here are some outcomes (rules if you will) for conditional statements.
# true && true --->> true
# false && false ---> false
# true || false --->> true
# true && false ---false
# true && (false || false) ---> false
# (true && false) || true ---> true
# false ---> false
# !false ---> true
# !(true && true) ---> false  

# Here is an example of how to exceute code conditionally:
# variable_containing_boolean = true
# if (variable_containing_boolean)
#   puts "A string that returns if that boolean is true."
# else (variable_containing_boolean)
#   puts "A string that returns if that boolean is false"
# end

# REMEMBER that any of the outcomes for the conditional statements could be used in our example for our conditional logic. To explain that better here is a simple example to give you a better idea on what that might look like:
# soup = true
# chips = false

# if (soup && chips) #if both products are true(ly vegan products)
#   p "All of our products are vegan friendly!"
# else 
#   p "Made in a facility where nuts, and animal byproducts are processed."
# end
# returns >>> "Made in a facility where nuts, and animal byproducts are processed."
