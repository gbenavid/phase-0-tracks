# This program should allow our interior designer to enter the following details about their 
# client: 
# name, 
# age, 
# number of children, and
# decor theme

# Note: Use symbols



# ----- The Program -----
# Promt the user for all of this information.

# Convert any user input to the appropriate data type.

# Print the hash back out to the screen when the designer has answered all of the questions.

# Give the user the opportunity to update a key, because sometimes users make mistakes! 
# If the designer says "none", skip it. But if the designer enters "decor_theme" (for example), your program should ask for a new value and update the :decor_theme key. (Hint: Strings have methods that will turn them into symbols, which would be quite handy here.) You can assume the user will correctly input a key that exists in your hash -- no need to handle user errors.

# Print the latest version of the hash, and exit the program.
