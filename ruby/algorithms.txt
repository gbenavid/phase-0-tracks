1. Write the algorithm for using an elevator. Spell everything out.
- Find the elevator door
	- Scan the upper portion of the walls (4 feet) from the ceiling until a series of lights are detected.
	- Otherwise scan the upper portion of the walls (4 feet) from the ceiling until two doors moving apart horizontally are detected. 
- Navigate towards the doors and or (elevator) lights above the door. 
	- If a wall is reached and is obstructing path to elevator, then move to the left (20 degree angle) until able to move freely once more.
	- continue towards the elevator.
- Find the corresponding button.
	- Scan the area of the elevator, (two feet beyond the doors) for a number.
- Press the button
	- If the number is the number you need then stay on the same floor. 
	- Otherwise, if the number is greater than the number you need press the down arrow key located near the elevator.
	- Otherwise press the up arrow key.
-Pass through the door when the doors open.
	- Scan the room for a series of circular lights.
	- Loop through each number (from top row to bottom & from left to right) until the vaule of the floor matches the number on the button. 
	- If the button matches the floor, press the button.
- Pass through the door when the floor is reached

2. Come up with an example of a common task in your life that could be translated into an algorithm.

Sorting laundry that's left in front of the tub
- Start in the bathroom (coordinates 'xyz')
- Find clothes
	- Scan four feet in front of bathtub
	- Evaluate object
		- If object is less than 2lbs and shorter than 6 inches and is within 4 feet of the bathtub, then pick up object.
		- Keep picking up clothes until the entire surface is free of misplaced items
- Find hamper
	- navigate into main room and locate hamper (coordinates 'xyz')
- Empty clothes into hamper
	- Raise clothes above the height of the hamper
	- Place the clothes in the center of the opening of the hamper
	- Drop clothes into the hamper.
		- repeat the process until all clothes are inside the hamper.
