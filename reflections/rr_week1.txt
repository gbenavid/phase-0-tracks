2. *Git*
  * *Version control* is used by developers to work on individual features of a project without jeopardizing the work that's on the master branch.
  * A *commit* is used when a small bit of progress has been made on a feature. It's followed by a message to help other developers understand and track progress. A good message is concise and detailed.
  * A *branch* is a replica of the master. Work done here will not appear on the master until it is merged. 
  * The 3 stages of a git change are: data is modified, git add file_name, and git commit -m "your message here."
