# Git Definitions
1. What is version control?  
..* Version control is a useful way of maintaining various 'versions' of our project. Feature branches can be made to alter our original data in some way. When we've finished a feature (some code we're working on that pertains to the larger project) we can merge it back into the master. Why is it useful? Version control is key when working on a project, especially big ones, because you can work on a feature branch, break the entire program, and then start over again without harming your original data. Overall its just a safer way to work on a project.

2. What is a branch and why would you use one?
..* We use branches, which are essentially copies of our work in our master file, to safely work on project features without worrying about affecting the code we have already committed and saved to the master. It's also easier to understand the work flow of the project, so everyone knows what branch is influencing what. Always use a branch because you never want to work directly on your master file!

3. What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
..* A commit creates a save-point in Git, a good commit message is one that's descriptive enough for other developers to understand. It should include brief and effective messages that notify everyone of a small accomplishment in regards to the feature their working on.

4. What is a merge conflict?
..* You can get a merge conflict error when trying to pull or merge from a branch in Git.
Git Work flow
When working in Git, you will be following one a basic work flow to create save points and protect your work.
