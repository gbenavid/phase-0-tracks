# Release 0:
 * Spend 10 minutes making a plan for how you intend to tackle jQuery and learn as much as you can in two hours.
 	- Terminology (15 mins)
 	- How terms connect to each other. (15 mins)
 * What sorts of resources will help?
 	- Videos (10-20 mins)
 	- Reputable sites (15-20 mins)
 	- Respectable blog posts (10-15 mins)
 	- Book (25 mins)
 * How often should you stop and test what you just learned?
 	- I will stop and test my work every 25 mins
 	- I will document my learning every 15-20 mins (10 mins)
 * I believe this approach will allow me to steadily gain on the material, and help me avoid burnout. This is my first time executing an documented approach on my learning.

 ## TERMINOLOGY:
 	- DOM: The Document Obj. Model uses objects to create a representation of the current page. It *creates a new object for each element* within a page.
 	- JQUERY: A JS file that you include in your web pages. It lets you find new elements using CSS-style selectors and then *do something with the elements using jQuery methods*. 

## In my own words:
	jQuery's motto is 'Write less, do more,' because it allows for shorted JS code. With jQuery you can select elements, preform tasks, and handle events. 
	
### Select Elements:
Selecting an element with jQuery is simpler because it uses CSS-style selectors that do it with DOM queries. This is also more powerful and flexible.

### Preform Tasks:
You can update the DOM tree, animate elements in and out of view, loop through a set of elements, all in one line of code.

### Handel Events:
Methods are included that allow you to attach event listeners to selected elements without having to write any fallback code to support older browsers.
