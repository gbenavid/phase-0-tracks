# Release 0:
 * Spend 10 minutes making a plan for how you intend to tackle jQuery and learn as much as you can in two hours.
 	- Terminology
 	- How terms connect to each other.
 * What sorts of resources will help?
 	- Videos (10-20 mins)
 	- Reputable sites (15-20 mins)
 	- Respectable blog posts (10-15 mins)
 * How often should you stop and test what you just learned?
 	- I will stop and test my work every 25 mins
 	- I will document my learning every 50 mins (10 mins)
 * I believe this approach will allow me to steadily gain on the material, and help me avoid burnout. This is my first time executing an documented approach on my learning.
